# Geohash Encoder and Decoder 

This is a Geohash encoder program that encodes a given latitude and longitude to its corresponding geohash. For any given location on earth, Geohash encoder converts the latitude and longitude into a unique string.

## What is Geohash

A geohash is a convenient way of expressing a location using a short alphanumeric string. As the geohash strings gets longer, the location can be obtained with greater precision. 

### Geohash Encoder

Geohash Encoder coverts a tuple of latitude and longitude to its corresponding geohash. 

An example of how the geohash encoder system works here is as follows:

### Geohash Decoder

A geohash decoder converts a geohash into its corresponding tuple of latitude and longitude. 

An example of how the geohash decoder system works here is as follows:
